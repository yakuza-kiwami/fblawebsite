### Prompt
Create a website for your schoolâ€™s guidance department so students can easily search job postings and employers can easily submit them.
Your website must include the following functionalities:
- A page for employers to submit postings (employers)
- A backend panel to approve or delete postings (guidance)
- A page displaying the approved postings (students/listing)
- A page for students to apply for the posting (students/applications)
## Current Activity
- Making mockups of website pages on paper
- Sorting out a calendar for our purposes
## Audit
What do we already have, what do we need to improve, and what do we need to add?
### Already Have
- Pages for each (submit postings, approve/delete, display postings, applications)
- Demo for employer & guidance dept. password authentication for their pages
### Need to Add
- JavaScript application and posting submission parsing, rather than faking
### Room for Improvement
- Button design
- Aesthetics
